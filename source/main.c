/** 
 * @mainpage API Specification
 *
 * This document contains the whole API specification for the BNG Bootloader
 * project, as generated by the Doxygen documentation generator tool.
 * 
 * The document is built from the C sources into different formats, it's made
 * available in HTML and PDF formats. Please refer to the project's
 * documentation for the exact location of these documents.
 * 
 * The complete project (prosa) documentation is built from ReST sources using
 * Sphinx and can be found in HTML format at the address:
 * http://garetjax.github.com/Bootloader/
 *
 * @section Overview
 *
 * @todo  Move this documentation to another file or to the Sphinx documentation.
 *
 * Before presenting the in-depth API documentation, the UML diagram in Fig. 1.1
 * was created to present an higher-level overview of the API.
 *
 * The \c Controller "class" representes our \c main function, and is
 * responsible for the initialization of the various parts of the system,
 * their respective interconnection (serial interface initialization, command
 * registration,...) and the routing of every received command to the command
 * dispatcher, which will in turn call the right command passing the parsed
 * tokens as arguments.
 *
 * Each command will then execute its task interacting with either the
 * application manager or the configuration registry. 
 * 
 * @note
 *   - Different realation graphs are automatically generated by Doxygen during the
 *     build phase, please refer to them for an in-dept view.
 *   - In the diagram below, each package representes a component, a class a C
 *     source file and the methods, the different functions contained in the
 *     file (the only exception is the \c Command interface, which representes
 *     the type of a command like function).
 *   - The details about the function prototypes where omitted for the
 *     sake of clarity.
