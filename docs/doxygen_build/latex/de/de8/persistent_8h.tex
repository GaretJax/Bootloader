\subsection{Detailed Description}
Interface to read/write/erase operations on a persistent storage device.

The prototypes contained in this file can be implemented multiple times to be adapted to different storage devices such as Hard Disk Drives, Flash memory devices or RAMs (i.e. for development and testing purposes). 

Definition in file {\bf persistent.h}.

Deletes some data from the permanent storage handler compiled with this function.

\begin{Desc}
\item[{\bf Todo}]Define the possible error numbers and their respective meaning.\end{Desc}

\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
\item[\mbox{$\leftarrow$} {\em address}]The address from which to start to delete the data from the storage device. \item[\mbox{$\leftarrow$} {\em length}]The number of bytes to delete from the storage device, starting at the given address.\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
The number of bytes deleted, a negative number if an error occurred.
